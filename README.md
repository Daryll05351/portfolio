# Daryll Lee - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Daryll! I have an business operation background in FMCG and F&B Manufacturing, has been managing ERP related field such as procurement, operations, production, technical, sales & marketing, and project management. Later in my career, I had developed Data Science skills from Coursera, DataCamp, Kaggles and others to improve my data analytic toolbox. I have discovered my passion towards data discovery -- uncovering meaningful insights, comes along with consistent self-growth on both personal and career development. 

In my data analytics studies and projects, I have learnt to handle large, complex, and inconsistent datasets. Organise dataset into useful clean datasets and perform all kinds of EDA, statistical analysis, identifying patterns and trends, predicting models, and sharing insights to stakeholders.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and looking for real-world business problem that could be solve using existing data. Adaptability and effective communication makes me a good team player in all kinds of role.

### Analyze Employee Turnover Rate and Create Predictive Models Salifort Motors

**Code**: [Salifort Motors Project.ipynb](https://github.com/Daryll05351/portfolio/blob/main/Salifort%20Motors%20Project.ipynb)

**PACE Doc**: [Salifort Motor PACE document]()

**Project Summary**: [Salifort Motor Project Summary]()

**Goal**: To analyze a dataset and build predictive models that can provide insights to the Human Resources (HR) department of a large consulting firm.

**Description**: The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. They collected data from employees, but now they don’t know what to do with it. They refer data analytics professional to provide data-driven suggestions based on the understanding of the data. They have the following question: what’s likely to make the employee leave the company?

The goal in this project are to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.

If possible to predict employees likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.
