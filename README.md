## About

Hi, I'm Daryll! I have an business operation background in FMCG and F&B Manufacturing, has been managing ERP related field such as procurement, operations, production, technical, sales & marketing, and project management. Later in my career, I had developed Data Science skills from Coursera, DataCamp, Kaggles and more to improve my data analytic toolbox. I have discovered my passion towards data discovery -- uncovering meaningful insights, comes along with consistent self-growth on both personal and career development. 

In my data analytics studies and projects, I have learnt to handle large, complex, and inconsistent datasets. Organise dataset into useful clean datasets and perform all kinds of EDA, statistical analysis, identifying patterns and trends, predicting models, and sharing insights to stakeholders.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and looking for real-world business problem that could be solve using existing data. Adaptability and effective communication makes me a good team player in all kinds of role.
